# Welcome to my Repo

Here you will find my code and data used for my Final Project titled: "Renyi Entanglement Entropy in FLOUQET Hamiltonians Using Qiskit." The python notebook
was used primarily as a debugging tool for the two main code bases: run_simulation.py, and run_simulation_2.py. These codebases are supported by imports.py,
which contains all function definitions and imports used in my project. The data and graphs presented in my paper can be found under ./data/.
